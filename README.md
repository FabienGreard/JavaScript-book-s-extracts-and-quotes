| You-Dont-Know-JS | Statement | In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a statement. |
| You-Dont-Know-JS | Expression  | Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators. |
| Speaking JavaScript | Closure |	A closure is a function plus the connection to the variables of its surrounding scopes.  |

| Speaking JavaScript | Hoisting | Hoisting means “moving to the beginning of a scope.” Function declarations are hoisted completely, variable declarations only partially. |
